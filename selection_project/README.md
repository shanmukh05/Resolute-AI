# Resolute-AI

Following is a project of counting number of pipes in a given image.\
I used python **pillow(PIL)** library to do this task.\
Idea is to detect edges and then detecting circular edges using **CANNY algorithm**.

## Given Image
![Input Image](https://github.com/shanmukh05/Resolute-AI/blob/main/selection_project/input.jpeg)\

#### After applying *canny.py* code on input image the output image looks like this
## Canny Image

#### Final output is obtained by running *circle.py* python code on input image

## Output Image
